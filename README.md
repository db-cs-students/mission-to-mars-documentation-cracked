## Justins Cracked at Fortnite My Guy


### Process Overview
During most of the process involving Tinkercad, Jackson and I did most of the planning and design, going back and forth with ideas and such. In the beginning, we had a box of maximum dimensions. We first printed that, but then realized we needed to cut down on the weight and size, as well as the fact that our box had thick walls, which added to the weight. 
After another failed attempt, we made a box that was sustainable and could last longer than both combined, which was very stable. Though it took more time to print and shape, it was more effective.

However, during the coding and pairing of the microbits, it was spearheaded by Jackson and Alex. 


#### Box

(Although at a bad angle) This was our final design. As you can see, the walls were slimmed down than compared our first and second designs. Our second design, though not shown, was written off as a failure. We made a mistake when rendering, which caused part of the support (beams?) walls to print badly and fall off.  Besides this mistake, we added the wall in the middle to hold the battery pack in place to prevent any disconnects or large bursts of movement. Visible at the top left of the box is a beam/wall. That is what we added to hold our microbit higher in the air, so it could be separated and above the battery pack.
