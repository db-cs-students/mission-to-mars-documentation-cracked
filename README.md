## Justins Cracked at Fortnite My Guy


### Process Overview
During most of the process involving Tinkercad, Jackson and I did most of the planning and design, going back and forth with ideas and such. In the beginning, we had a box of maximum dimensions. We first printed that, but then realized we needed to cut down on the weight and size. 
After another failed attempt, we made a box that was sustainable and could last longer than both combined, which was very stable. Though it took more time to print and shape, it was more effective.
